Mac OS X 10.7 Lion is the eighth major release of Apple's desktop operating system, which was released in July 2011. It introduced many new features, such as Mission Control, Launchpad, AirDrop, and full-screen apps. However, it also dropped support for some older Mac models that used PowerPC processors or 32-bit Intel processors.

If you have a PC that meets the minimum requirements for running Lion, you might be wondering if you can install it on your machine and enjoy the benefits of Apple's software. The answer is yes, but it is not a straightforward process. You will need to download a modified version of the Lion installer that can boot on a PC, burn it to a DVD or a USB drive, and then follow some steps to configure your BIOS settings and install the necessary drivers.
 
In this article, we will show you how to do that using a file called "Mac OS X 10.7 Lion Install DVD For PC.rar", which is a compressed archive that contains the modified Lion installer. You can find this file on various websites that host Hackintosh files, such as [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/install-mac-os-x-lion-10.7.0-lion) [^1^] or [niresh12495](https://archive.org/details/niresh-12495-lion-10.7.3-v-2) [^2^]. However, be aware that downloading and installing Mac OS X on a non-Apple hardware is against Apple's terms of service and may violate their intellectual property rights.
 
## What You Will Need
 
- A PC with an x86-64 CPU (64-bit Macs, with an Intel Core 2 Duo , Intel Core i5 , Intel Core i7, or Xeon processor.)
- At least 2 GB of RAM
- At least 7 GB of free disk space
- A DVD burner or a USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of capacity
- A blank DVD or a USB flash drive
- A copy of "Mac OS X 10.7 Lion Install DVD For PC.rar"

- A software to burn the .iso file to a DVD or a USB drive, such as ImgBurn or Rufus
- A backup of your important data on your PC

## Step 1: Extract the .rar File
 
The first step is to extract the .rar file that contains the modified Lion installer. To do that, you will need a software that can handle .rar files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can download them for free from their official websites.
 
Once you have installed the software, right-click on the "Mac OS X 10.7 Lion Install DVD For PC.rar" file and choose "Extract Here" or "Extract to Mac OS X 10.7 Lion Install DVD For PC". This will create a folder with the same name as the .rar file, which contains an .iso file called "Install Mac OS X Lion.iso". This is the file that you will need to burn to a DVD or a USB drive.
 
## Step 2: Burn the .iso File to a DVD or a USB Drive
 
The next step is to burn the .iso file to a blank DVD or a USB flash drive. To do that, you will need a software that can create bootable media from .iso files, such as ImgBurn or Rufus. You can download them for free from their official websites.
 
If you are using ImgBurn, insert a blank DVD into your DVD burner and launch the software. Click on "Write image file to disc" and then click on the folder icon next to "Source". Browse to the folder where you extracted the .rar file and select the "Install Mac OS X Lion.iso" file. Click on "Write" and wait for the process to finish.
